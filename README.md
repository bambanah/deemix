# Deemix

This is the monorepo for the revived Deemix project, originally created by the very talented [RemixDev](https://gitlab.com/RemixDev).

The docker image was heavily inspired by the fantastic work of [Bockiii](https://gitlab.com/Bockiii/deemix-docker).

### Packages in this Repo

- **deezer-sdk**: Wrapper for Deezer's [API](https://developers.deezer.com/api)
- **deemix**: The brains of the operation
- **webui**: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web interface
- **gui**: Packaged [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app

## Downloads

### Standalone Electron App

[https://github.com/bambanah/deemix/releases](https://github.com/bambanah/deemix/releases)

Note: The app is not signed (because it's crazy expensive), so you'll need to disable the security warnings when running it.

#### For MacOS

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/deemix.app
```

### Docker Image

Deemix is also available as a [docker image](https://github.com/bambanah/deemix/pkgs/container/deemix).

#### Example Usage

```bash
docker run -d --name Deemix \
  -v /path/to/music:/downloads \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  -p 6595:6595 \
  ghcr.io/bambanah/deemix:latest
```

#### Parameters

All paremeters are optional - if not specified, the default value will be used.

You'll probably want to at least map the download and config folders, as well as the port.

## Developing

This repo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) for monorepo management.

### Dependencies

- Enable pnpm:
  ```bash
  corepack enable
  ```
